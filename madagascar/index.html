		<p>Though it's only around the size of Texas, Madagascar is home to more than 10,000 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism">endemic</a> plant and animal species (<a href="http://www.worldwildlife.org/places/madagascar">WWF</a>). Many of these species are now threatened due to deforestation and habitat loss. Among these is the world's most endangered group of mammals, lemurs.</p>

			More than 90% of lemur species are either threatened or endangered. With continued deforestation, climate change, and all the other threats the future holds, it is critical that we take steps to protect lemurs and their habitats before it's too late.
			<br /><br />
			Lemurs' charisma and unique appearance create an opportunity to brand them as a <a href="http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/species/flagship_keystone_indicator_definition/">flagship species</a>. By using lemurs to generate interest in conservation, we can protect thousands of other "less exciting" species.

		<h2>Madagascar's Land Cover and Protected Areas</h2>
		<iframe width="100%" height="720" frameborder="0" src="https://tkhowlett.cartodb.com/viz/251eb12a-1020-11e6-9cd0-0ecfd53eb7d3/embed_map" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe>
		<p>As the map shows, Madagascar has very little forested land, and less than 3% of its land is officially protected by the government. Unfortunately, illegal harvesting often takes place even on these limited protected lands.</p>

		<h2>Ranomafana National Park and CentreValBio</h2>
		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/nE2Vax1.png">
		This map shows the boundaries of Ranomafana National Park, located in southeastern Madagascar as indicated above. The park is home to a myriad of rare species, including over one hundred frog species and more than a dozen lemur species (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranomafana_National_Park">Wikipedia</a>).
		<br /><br />
		The star on the map indicates the location of <a href="http://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/centre-valbio/">Centre ValBio</a> (CVB), a research station ounded by Dr. Patricia Wright, best known for her research on the social interactions of lemurs. CVB describes their three main objectives as:
		<ul>
			<li>To promote world-class research in one of the worldâ€™s most biologically diverse and unique ecosystems.</li>
			<li>To encourage environmental conservation by developing ecologically  sustainable economic development programs with local villages</li>
			<li>To provide the local villagers with the knowledge and tools to improve their quality of life through projects focused on sanitation, diet, and education, and ultimately reduce poverty in the area.</li>
		</ul>
		CVB is just one of many organizations involved in the fight to save lemurs and biodiversity in Madagascar. Biologists, conservationists, anthropologists, and experts from all over the world are working hard to find solutions that will not only protect Madagascar's ecological integrity, but also enrich the lives of the Malagasy people.
